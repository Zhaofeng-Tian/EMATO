# Energy-Efficient Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving

## Abstract

Autonomous driving technologies face challenges related to energy efficiency, particularly due to the limitations of energy-model-agnostic trajectory planning. This repository presents a novel online nonlinear programming method aimed at optimizing polynomial trajectories generated by the Frenet polynomial method. The proposed approach takes into account traffic trajectories and road slope predictions to develop an energy consumption model-aware trajectory planning system. 

Additionally, our research explores how to effectively utilize the energy model across various driving conditions to enhance energy efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive case studies, quantitative analyses, and ablation studies conducted on both sedan and truck models.

## Features

- Energy consumption model-aware trajectory planning
- Online nonlinear programming optimization
- Integration of traffic and road slope predictions
- Extensive validation through case studies and quantitative analysis
